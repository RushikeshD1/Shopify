# React App with User Authentication

This is a simple React application demonstrating basic user authentication, including login, registration, and authorization persistence using `localStorage`. The application includes several key components and features that enhance user interaction.

## Features

- **Home Component**: Displays the main page of the application with general information.
- **Product Component**: Displays a list of products and allows users to interact with product data.
- **User Component**: Shows user-specific details after login and registration.
- **Contact Component**: Provides a contact form for users to reach out.
- **Login and Register**: Allows users to either login with existing credentials or register as a new user.
- **Logout Button**: Allows users to log out and clears authentication states.
- **Persistent Authorization**: `isAuthorized` state is stored in `localStorage`, ensuring user session persists across page reloads.
